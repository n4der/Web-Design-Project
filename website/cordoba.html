                <p><strong>C&oacute;rdoba</strong> also called <strong>Cordova</strong> in English, is a city in Andalusia, southern Spain, and the capital of the province of C&oacute;rdoba. The old town contains numerous architectural reminders of when <em>Corduba</em> was the capital of Hispania Ulterior during the Roman Republic and capital of Hispania Baetica during the Roman Empire. It was conquered by invading Islamic armies in the eighth century. <em>Qur?ubah</em> then became the capital of the Islamic Emirate and then Caliphate of C&oacute;rdoba, including most of the Iberian Peninsula</p>

            <p><strong>Cordoba</strong> is situated in the interior of Andalusia where past and modernity blend in together. This thousand-year-old city, which has the <strong>World Heritage</strong> designation, is a living legacy of the different cultures that settled here throughout its history. Not many places in the world can say they have been the capital of Hispania Ulterior (Further Spain) under the Roman Empire, and capital of the <strong>Umayyad Caliphate</strong>. This splendour can also be seen because of the intellectualism of this city of knowledge, where figures like <strong>Seneca</strong>, Averroes or Maimonides were born. If you walk round the old quarter you will discover a beautiful network of alleyways, squares and white-washed courtyards surrounding the <strong>Great Mosque-Cathedral</strong>, which reflects the importance of the city in the Middle Ages, and is the symbol of the city.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Without disregarding its splendid past, Cordoba is definitely a modern city that has been able to adapt to the present day, offering the most <strong>modern infrastructures</strong> and services, as well as a large network of hotels. Very well connected to the other Andalusian capitals, Cordoba also has the <strong>high speed train (AVE)</strong> and a very extensive railway network linking it to all the big cities, like Madrid and Seville. Once inside the city, a large network of <strong>buses</strong> and <strong>taxis</strong> enable visitors to reach any destination in a few minutes. Cordoba is also synonymous with <strong>art</strong>, <strong>culture</strong> and <strong>leisure</strong>, thanks to a myriad of cultural events that are organised here throughout the year: Flamenco festivals, concerts, ballet and other activities that are complemented by a number of museums and an exciting nightlife.Meanwhile, the province is home to important buildings of the <strong>Andalusian heritage</strong>, whose highest expression is the <strong>Medina Azahara</strong>, located on the outskirts of the city. But there is great spectacle also for nature lovers. The parks of Sierra de Carde&ntilde;a in Los Pedroches and Montoro, the Hornachuelos Sierra and Sierras Subb&eacute;ticas offer the possibility of practising all kinds of open-air sports, while at the same time enjoying the natural wealth of this province.</p>

            <h2>Flying to Cordoba</h2>

            <p>There is no international airport in Cordoba. The best option is probably to fly to <a href="http://www.sevilla-airport.com/en/index.php" target="_blank">Seville</a>, the airport being located 1.5 hours along the A4 motorway from Cordoba. <a href="http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite?cid=1048858947193&amp;pagename=subHome&amp;SiteName=AGP&amp;c=Page&amp;Language=EN_GB" target="_blank">Malaga airport </a>&nbsp;is 2 hours away but is also an option since it is the main airport in Andaluc&iacute;a.</p>

            <h2>Trains</h2>

            <p>You can travel to Cordoba using the AVE high speed train (acronym for <em>Alta Velocidad Espa&ntilde;ola; an ave is also a bird in Spanish</em>) from Seville (45min, 32.40 euro single) and Madrid (2h, 66.90 euro single). The train station is located in the northwest of the city. You can also get regular trains to and from Granada (2h20, 34.60 euro single), Malaga (1h, 21.20 euro single) and other seaside destinations.</p>

            <h2>Bus</h2>

            <p>Bus and coach services are one of the cheapest ways to travel in Spain. The <em>Estacion Central de Autobuses de Cordoba</em>, the main bus station, is located near the RENFE train station, in Glorieta de las Tres Culturas s/n (phone +34 957404383). You should be able to connect with many places, from Spanish main cities to rural Andalucian towns and local villages.</p>

            <h2>Taxis</h2>

            <p>Driving inside Cordoba can be tricky, especially in the old town. You should have no difficulty in finding a taxi if you need it, though you should not expect the driver to speak English. The meter marks up the basic fare but a supplement may be added after midnight and during public holidays. Some taxi drivers may try to charge you a higher price, especially if you don&#39;t speak the language, but there is an official price list which you should ask the taxi driver for.</p>

            <h2>City Buses</h2>

            <p>Cordoba urban transport is managed by the bus company Aucorsa. Single tickets costs 1.10 euro but the company offers the usual discounts, such as travel cards (6.50 euro for 10 trips). Many bus stands have clear route maps and diagrams but the bus company website also provides handy information. From the Coach or RENFE train station a no 3 or 13 bus should get you to the city centre. For more information, check out the <a href="http://www.aucorsa.es/portal/aucorsa/es/titulosTarifas/" target="_blank">company website</a>. A few companies also operate to the nearby villages. You can find more at the <em>Estacion Central de Autobuses de Cordoba</em> itself.</p>
